## Send Auth
We'll get a `code` by sending auth:
```dart
   import 'package:fluwx/fluwx.dart' as fluwx;
   fluwx.sendAuth(
         scope: "snsapi_userinfo", state: "wechat_sdk_demo_test")ï¼›
```
Getting `access_token` is not supported in `fluwx`. For `access_token`, please visity the official documents.


## Receive SendAuth Result

```dart
fluwx.responseFromAuth.listen((data) {
     //do something.
    });
```
