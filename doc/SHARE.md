### Summary
`Fluwx` doesn't support all kind of sharing.Only text, image, web page,
music, video and mini program are supported.We'll consider the more.
More support will be considered in the future.
.


 >  NOTE：Images or thumbnails used for sharing only support `png`and`jpg`.Network or assets images are OK.<br>
 >  However,using images from `assets`,you have to add a schema `assets://`。<br>
 >  For assets image from  a particular package,you have to add a query param:`?package=package_name`<br>
 >  If you want to use local image,`file://` must be provided.For example, a local image path should be "file://path/to/your/image.jpg". <br>
 >  If no schema or wrong schema provided,`Fluwx` will load it as network image.Be careful<br>
 >  Due to the limits of WeChat，the thumbnail must be smaller than 32k(mini-program's is smaller than 120k),you'd better provide <br>
 >  a qualified thumbnail.Otherwise, `Fluwx` will compress it for you. The result of compression is unpredictable.<br>
 >  Considering that we may obtain a path such as *content://media/external/file* on Android, `fluwx` also support reading image or thumbnail from `content://`.<br>
 >  `content://` only works on Android.
### The Destination
    The destination of sharing can be SESSION(default),TIMELINE or FAVORITE.However,mini-program only support SESSION.
```dart
    ///[WeChatScene.SESSION]会话
    ///[WeChatScene.TIMELINE]朋友圈
    ///[WeChatScene.FAVORITE]收藏
    enum WeChatScene {
      SESSION,
      TIMELINE,
      FAVORITE
      }
```
### Return
 the return value of `fluwx.share(model)` is `Map`：
```dart
    {
       "platform":"Android",//or iOS
       result:true //or false，depends on WXApi.sendRequest()
     }
```


### Share Text

  fluwx.share(WeChatShareTextModel(
      text: "text from fluwx",
      transaction: "transaction}",
      scene: scene
    ));
```
### Share Image
```dart
 fluwx.share(WeChatShareImageModel(
        image: _imagePath,
        thumbnail: _thumbnail,
        transaction: _imagePath,

        description: "image"));
```
>  NOTE：`Fluwx` will create thumbnail from `image` if thumbnail isn't provided.
